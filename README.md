Description:
This repository demonstrates the capabilities of Google's GEMINI Generative AI model in building innovative applications across three key areas:

Vision AI: Leverage GEMINI's powerful image recognition and understanding to create intelligent visual experiences.
Chatbots: Develop engaging and informative chatbots powered by GEMINI's natural language processing and generation.
Question Answering: Design effective Q&A systems that provide accurate and insightful responses using GEMINI's knowledge base and reasoning abilities.


Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or later) installed on your system. You can verify this by running python --version in your terminal.
If you don't have Python, download and install it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install the required libraries using pip:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
